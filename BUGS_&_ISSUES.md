Some bugs to be fixed:

- player doesn't always spawn in the middle like supposed to (most likely caused by random spawn position of Tree)
- Tree moves horizontally with the player when the player moves around in some locations
- Tree spawns with the wrong sprite (either "/\" or "/\<linebreak>/\" instead of "^<linebreak>/\" like supposed to)
- player teleports when moving around in some areas
- moving over the top border of the window causes the player sprite to fill the entire column
- swapped player model only updated when player moves (worked fine in v1.01)

Other issues:
- the player's 'gun' disappears if player swaps skin
- clean Frame.py's spaghetti code
- document the whole thing
